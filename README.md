# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Overview

This project recreates the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. Key features of the game include:

- Snake movement in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- Randomly generated food items for the snake to eat.
- Scoring system to keep track of the player's score.
- Game over condition when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## Gameplay

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- The objective is to eat the red food items to increase your score.
- Avoid hitting the walls or running into the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
